## Description 

This project is a quiz game using javascript.
It creates a quiz interface with questions and answers, keeps track of score, and includes a timer to track how long it takes you.
Using queryselector we select html elements and assigns them to variables.
We have an array holding all of our questions and answers, the javascript implements these values.
When the game is started everything but the header and the score box are hidden and the question container is shown
event listeners were added to the buttons so that the functions associated will be called on.
Overall, this code sets up a quiz game, handles user interaction, and provides feedback and scoring functionality.
